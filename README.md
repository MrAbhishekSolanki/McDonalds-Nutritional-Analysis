# McDonald's EDA Project

## Overview

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on the McDonald's dataset. The analysis focuses on understanding the nutritional composition, diversity, and characteristics of menu items within each category.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this EDA project are as follows:

1. **Nutrient Distribution by Category:**
   - Examine and visualize the distribution of key nutrients, including carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, across different food categories within the McDonald's menu.

2. **Sugar Content by Categories:**
   - Investigate and plot the total sugar content in various food categories to understand the variation in sugar levels across different menu items.

3. **Average Cholesterol Values:**
   - Calculate and visualize the average cholesterol values for each food category to identify categories with higher or lower average cholesterol content.

4. **Number of Unique Items per Category:**
   - Determine and analyze the number of unique items within each food category to understand the diversity and variety of menu offerings.

5. **Average Calories in Each Category:**
   - Compute and visualize the average calorie content for each food category to gain insights into the overall energy contribution of different menu items.

6. **Total Sodium Count by Category:**
   - Explore and represent the total sodium content within each food category to identify categories with varying sodium levels.

## How to Use
